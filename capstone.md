### Problem Statement
The NBA is a fast-paced game where game flow and online betting line changes occur rapidly. We hypothesize a market of this size but with a relatively low maturity can be ripe with inefficiencies which we can uncover and capitalize on by modeling historic game stats and live moving lines to predict game outcomes.

### My Role
**Data Scientist, Data Modeler**
- Studied, dissected, engineered and transformed multiple datasets (i.e. data munging) to prepare for feeding into models
- Programmed and built regression and classification models in Python
- Designed experiments to test, verify, and compare prediction models performance
- Summarized and translated findings to business recommendation

### Goals
1. Identify NBA team and game characteristics which would rank the highest impact to scoring and betting metrics
2. Produce predictive models to predict betting outcomes
3. Create prescriptive applications that incorporate NBA game & online betting statistics with recommended bets to increase end user profitability

### End-to-End Solution
1. Raw data and engineered features (Python)
2. Game stats and betting data visualization (Python)
3. Prediction models (Python)
   - Pre-game bet classification: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine
   - In-game score regression: Random Forest
4. Data staging (Excel scripts)
5. Cloud-based BI Dashboard (DOMO)
6. Push alert, SMS text and email notification

### Conclusion
- Established a profitable NBA online betting strategy supported by historical data and prediction models
- Successful demonstration of an end-to-end prototype

### Next Steps
- Expand further on modeling
  - Incorporate linear programming optimization methods
  - Expand data source to include more recent seasons and playoffs
  - Design and engineer
